## Overview and Origin

<br> Wealthfront Inc. was founded as KaChink in 2008 in Palo Alto, CA by Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll. The idea for the company came about while Andy was teaching Technology Entreprenuership classes at Standford Graduate School of business. He would often be approached for financial and investment advice, but wasn't able to recommend the services he used because the minimum fees were too high for students. He saw a need to make those services more accessable for a wider audience.

 <br>While Andy came across this issue because of the students he worked with, Dan began working on it after opening a statement from the finacial advisor that his parents were using. He was shocked at what they were being charged and began working on an affordable solution and eventually built a prototype that gained some popularity and caught the eye of Andy.

 <br> The two began builiding their company with the Angel Round of investments taking place in December of 2008. Since then, the most recent round (Series E) took place in January of 2018 and Wealthfront Inc. has raised a total of $204.5 million in funding for their service. 


## Business Activities

<br>Wealthfront believes that everyone deserves sophisticated financial advice and wants to democratize access to that advice while fully automating wealth management for their clients. This is reflected in their mission statement which reads "Our mission is to build a financial system that favors people, not institutions. This company targets a wide audience, but their primary focus is young retail  investors ("millinneals who save"), who may have a distrust of big banks using similar technology. Wealthfront also targets High Networth Individuals (HNIs), as they are a rapidly growing segment of the the robo-advisor domain.  

Wealthfront's competitive edge lies in the combination of "Tax-Loss Harvesting" and "Self-Driving Money" which help investors make more money and allows them to directly deposit paychecks onto it's platform. These are the headline features, but there are several others offerings that make Wealthfront's product unique. Those include:

<br> - Publishing it's tax-loss harvesting results
<br> - Stock-level tax-loss harvesting, which allows havesting *within* an index.
<br> - A 0.25% management fee and free management on balances under $5000
<br> - A 529 account to help save for children's future educational experiences.
<br> - 1.40% APY on cash accounts, which is 20x the national average (0.07)
<br> - A Socially Responsible portfolio that screens each fund for environmental, social, and governance factors including carbon emissions, pollution, human rights, labor standards, and board composition. 
<br> - A suite of goal planning features collectively called "Path". Once their account is connected, users choose an initial goal and are given projections of how likely they are to hit their goals, based on academic research that accounts for inflation, income changes, market data, etc. 

<br> Wealthfront utilizes the following tools to build and develop it's product: Java script, Java, Gooogle Cloud Platform, Amazon CloudFront, Kotlin, C++, D3.js


## Landscape

<br>

Wealthfront focuses its efforts specifically in the Robo-Advisor & Wealth Management financial domains. While the company is already at the cutting edge of Robo-Avisor technology, there are several historical trends and recent innovations within each domain that should be considered as the company continues to improve its offerings.

<br> According to a 2016 publication by Deloitte, current Robo-Advisors have a four-step evolution of feature & service.

<br> --- Robo 1.0 - Clients fill out a questionaire and receive single-product proposals or portfolio based applications. Clients also buy and manage their product-based portfolio with out a bank or broker-API handling the execution. Products include stocks, bonds, & ETFS

<br> --- Robo 2.0 - The questionaire is used not only to select product, but also to assess risk. Investment portfolios are set up as a fund of funds, and asset management is handled manually by dedicated investment managers who adjust client portfolios in "semi-automatic" fashion. Mangagers make adjustments to investment algotrithims and define rule sets.

<br> --- Robo 3.0 - Algorithims are used to monitor and satisfy pre-defined investment strategies. These algorithims are the basis for investment decisions and portfolio rebalancing proposals. Final oversight of portfolios is handled by professional fund managers.

<br> --- Robo 4.0 - Self-learning AI investment algotrithims are developed using sophisticated profiling and risk management questionaires. Single client portfolios are adjusted in real-time using changing market conditions and individual investment needs. Client needs include profit, risk apetite, and liquidity. Adjustments are made by the AI, to keep clients on track with their investment strategies.

As Robo-Advisors have evolved, the market for them has grown exponentially year-over-year. For example, total assets under management have grown fron 0.3 Trillion to 1.79 Trillion since 2017 and total users have grown from 42.9 Million in 2017 to 348.3 Million in 2022. In that time, the united states has remained the leader in Robo-Advisors with China coming in at second, and Japan eclipsing the UK for third place in 2018.

Of the available models, Hybrid Robo-Advisors have become the most common , and are expected to grow at a faster rate than Pure Robo-Advisors. Most improvements made to the technology coincide with improvements in AI, advanced analytics, and natural language processing. 

There upcoming opportunity to further improve Robo-Advisors is immense, as global firms will compete for $9 Trillion in fresh assests under management between 2022 and 2025, while the ESG market expands to $50 Tillion. This is all according to a 2022 report by Insider Intelligence.

Wealthfront will compete for that market growth with companies such as: Betterment, Blooom, Charles Schwab Corporation, FMR LLC, Personal Capital Corporation, SoFi, SIGFIG, The Vanguard Group Inc., and WiseBanyan Inc. 

These key players have adapted to compete by implemting strategies that include product portfolio expansion, mergers & acquisitions, agreements, geographical expansion, and collaborations. This is all done with a goal to increase their market penetration and strengthen their foothold in this domain. 



## Results


Wealthfront is one of the original Robo-Advisors and currently has over 480,000 users while managing $28 billion in assests. The company continues to stand at the forefront of innovation; doing so with offerings such as their Socially Resposible Portfolio which is currently a driver in the rise of ESG investing.


Wealthfront measures overall success by the returns that their clients have earned on their investments. Since the company's inception, classic portfolios with a risk score of 9 have had their investments grow at a rate of 9.88% per year. 
The company also boasts about how the service pays for itself due to the success of it's tax-loss harvesting feature. According to their web-site, Wealthfront clients saw a 1.8% increase in their after-tax returns.
  
This company is an industry leader, has garnered years of positive reviews by it's consumer base, and is consistently regarded as one of the best Robo-Advisor offerings by companies such as Forbes, Nerdwallet, and Investopedia. 

## Recommendations

In a 2022 review, published by Investopedia, Wealthfront cost itself a perfect 5 star rating and received negative remarks due to it's quality of customer service. The reviewer noted that the company offers comprehensive FAQs and help center articles, but makes it difficult to speak with a person on the phone. Wealthfront believes that Robo-Advisors are better than human advisors, but neglecting the human elements of their service means that they're also neglecting a growing maket segment that prefers a Hybrid Robo-Advisor and human interaction.

I recommend that Wealthfront bolster it's customer service by adding live chat & product specialists who clients have easy access too. I also recommend that the company add human advisors, and do so specifically to promote their Socially Responsible Portfolio.

Quality customer service is a no-brainer for any company, let alone one that is considered a top competitor in a particular industry or domain. This seems to be Wealthfront's key weakness, and also one of it's key opportunities for growth. The rise of ESG investing and Wealthfront's clear desire to capitalize on the market growth make way for a Hybrid Robo-Advisor for clients who care about having the right data when customizing an ESG based portfolio. Focusing on this particualr market, would allow Wealthfront to test out the hybrid model without deviating fully from the idea of an automated service. 

Implementing these changes would not require that Wealthfront use brand new technology. The Java based tools that they have access to should be more than enough to create a dynamic live chat application, and the rest would come down to hiring the right people.
These technologies would be appropriate because they are already available and shouldn't cost Wealthfront very much money to develop.
